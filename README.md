## Why Did I Make This?
At my company, the #1 question that's asked after any presentation is, "Will you make your slides available?"  This
isn't much of a challenge for internal colleagues, but it can be difficult with an external audience.  GitHub is
a great tool for sharing code... so I wanted to see if I could also use it as place for sharing presentations.

I also wanted to see if the collaboration aspects of GitHub can be applied to presentations.

## How It's Built
To meet the objectives above, I wanted the ability to define presentations using MarkDown and have those easily
converted to a web-based presentation.  I settled on using [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) as my
framework.
